# AyaCrop
a quick and dirty python utility to help with parsings through and cropping screenshots.

## requirements
pygame and PIL

## how to use
update the input_dir and output_dir variables at the top of the file to point to your source and destination folders.
if you want, add or change the modifier variable to contain a suffix appended to your cropped images.
to save your place for later, you may update the "idx" variable. the program will start up on wherever you point your idx.

## there's a bug

this works for what i need it for, but feel free to fork this or send me a message or leave me a comment or whatever and i'll at least take a look.
